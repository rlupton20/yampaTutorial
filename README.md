# yampaTutorial
A yampa tutorial. This is still in its beginnings, but it aims to introduce Yampa from a more top-down viewpoint, but providing working code as soon as possible.

The tutorial is currently still being sketched out. The earliest examples are text based, but later a simple SDL based framework will be used to illustrate various signal functions.
