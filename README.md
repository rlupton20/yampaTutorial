# yampaTutorial
A yampa tutorial. This is still in its beginnings, but it aims to introduce Yampa from a more top-down viewpoint, but providing working code as soon as possible.

The tutorial is currently still being sketched out. The earliest examples are text based, but later a simple SDL based framework will be used to illustrate various signal functions.

Requires the Fira font set to be installed (with LaTeX) to build. Or just comment out use from yampa.tex.

Build with:

pdflatex yampa.tex
